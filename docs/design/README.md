### Target audience

**Identifying the target audience might be the most important thing to do before designing.**

Are you targeting young or mature people or both? Is your customera business? Is only 1 gender going to use the product?

For Example, if you are designing a try-on-makeup app, you might go with more feminie look. Or if you are selling the machines to the construction companies, you're not going to shoose the youthful style.

### Competitors

**Is there someone else solving the same or a similar problem?**

The bottom line is - don't look the same. Espacially not if the competitor is a wall-known brand. Avoir using the same colors, phrases and juste overall feel and look. Try to be original as much as possible.

### Color psychology

**Color influences perceptions that are not obvious, such as the taste of food.**

But keep in mind that gender, age and culture play a big role in perceiving colors. Don't rely heavily on these principles, but rather try to include the target audience's personalities as well. It's worth spending time on finding a good balance.

### Build your product's brand

#### A brand is more than a logo, a name or a set of colours and fonts.

* Know who your product is and what it stands for.
* You want to be easily recognisable and present an appealing identity.
* Make sure that under the looks, your future users will find something they resonate with.

#### Branding is what makes your product say:

> « This is who I am, this is what I do, this is what you can expect from me. »

**Branding is more than marketing efforts**, whose tactis are what's pushing users to check out your product's landing page and test your products. But it's your brand's strength that determines a user to stay **loyal** and **recommend** your product to their friends.

### Create a valuable user experience

#### If branding makes you consistent in who you are, user experience is what makes your product deliver the value you promised.

A positive user experience finds the balance between your **objectives as a business** (growing and turning profits) and the **goals of the users** (usually, solving a problem for them or satisfying a want they have).

#### Go where your users are and understand them.

* Map their processes, identify their frustations, test and validate your prototype with them.
* You may not always be able to give them what they want, but when you succeed in giving them what they need, they will appreciate you solving a problem for them.

### Create a delightful user interface

#### User interface is the face your product will show every day to the people using it.

* Strive to keep things clear and delightful for users.
* A great user interfae clarifies and supports the user's options and tasks, is pleasant for the eye and offers clear feedback on actions taken, but also manages to add delightful elements (i.e. a celebratory animation, an icon that conveys personality).
