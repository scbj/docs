### Target audience

**Identifying the target audience might be the most important thing to do before designing.**

Are you targeting young or mature people or both? Is your customera business? Is only 1 gender going to use the product?

For Example, if you are designing a try-on-makeup app, you might go with more feminie look. Or if you are selling the machines to the construction companies, you're not going to shoose the youthful style.

### Competitors

**Is there someone else solving the same or a similar problem?**

The bottom line is - don't look the same. Espacially not if the competitor is a wall-known brand. Avoir using the same colors, phrases and juste overall feel and look. Try to be original as much as possible.

### Color psychology

**Color influences perceptions that are not obvious, such as the taste of food.**

But keep in mind that gender, age and culture play a big role in perceiving colors. Don't rely heavily on these principles, but rather try to include the target audience's personalities as well. It's worth spending time on finding a good balance.

### Data

Just because you thing it looks cool, does'nt mean you should choose a dark UI theme. Data should be driving all of your decisions as a produt designer. Do the research and bring stats to the table before discussing a dark theme.

### Readability

Dark text on a light background is more widely used for better readabiity and focus during the day. However, the more time we spend concentrating on reading or writing in front of a screen, the more straining it becomes for our eyes. Code and video editors tend to have a dark theme for this exact reason. Track time spent on your product and if it's a lot then dark should trump light.

### Time of day

It's important to establish what time of day and environment your product will be used in. Bright light at night is not ideal for our eyres, hence why products like Netflix and Spotify rock a dark theme. Always try to make the user feel comfortable in their environment.

### Contrast

Sketch introduced a light theme to design tools. But, dark themes help shift focus on the main content area. Editing tools can appear complex with endless icons of cuntionnality. A dark theme shifts the primary focus to content with less contrast on the functionality options. Invision Studio is a prime example of a dark themed design tool. Focusing attention on artboards vs editing options.

### Light vs

It doesn't have to be one or the other.  lot of products offer preferences and remember not every user is the same. Customization increases conversion. If you have done the research and your product is user across day and night then don't beafrai to have a gradual shift from light to dark. Waze do this brilliantly if you need inspiration.

### Age

Successful products tend to have a very specific target audience. If your product is targeting gen x then it's an opportunity to explore a dark, more magical theme. However, for older generations, a light UI is less intimidating and higher contrast with bigger fonts should always be considered.

### ```#000000```

If you do adopt a dark theme avoid using ```#000000``` as your background color. The contrast is too high and a dark blue is far easier for readability. Blue is also the most important color in UI design and is the perfect primary if you are little afraid of tackling the dark theme in your product.

### ```#ffffff```

We've got a dark background so white text is a must. Absolutely not. Pure white should be used with caution because it can often be too strong against a dark background. Stark is a great Sketch plugin to show whether your designs pass or fail in accessbility and meet the minimum contrast ration of ```4.5:1```.

### Build your product's brand

#### A brand is more than a logo, a name or a set of colours and fonts.

* Know who your product is and what it stands for.
* You want to be easily recognisable and present an appealing identity.
* Make sure that under the looks, your future users will find something they resonate with.

#### Branding is what makes your product say:

> « This is who I am, this is what I do, this is what you can expect from me. »

**Branding is more than marketing efforts**, whose tactis are what's pushing users to check out your product's landing page and test your products. But it's your brand's strength that determines a user to stay **loyal** and **recommend** your product to their friends.

### Create a valuable user experience

#### If branding makes you consistent in who you are, user experience is what makes your product deliver the value you promised.

A positive user experience finds the balance between your **objectives as a business** (growing and turning profits) and the **goals of the users** (usually, solving a problem for them or satisfying a want they have).

#### Go where your users are and understand them.

* Map their processes, identify their frustations, test and validate your prototype with them.
* You may not always be able to give them what they want, but when you succeed in giving them what they need, they will appreciate you solving a problem for them.

### Create a delightful user interface

#### User interface is the face your product will show every day to the people using it.

* Strive to keep things clear and delightful for users.
* A great user interfae clarifies and supports the user's options and tasks, is pleasant for the eye and offers clear feedback on actions taken, but also manages to add delightful elements (i.e. a celebratory animation, an icon that conveys personality).
