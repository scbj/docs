features:
- title: ‚úç Empowering
  details: Empowering products enhance our abilities as humans without dictating our behavior by enabling us to accomplish our objective when we need it, and remaining out of the way when we don‚Äôt. We can achieve this by ensuring products center on the value they provide to people over companies.
- title: ‚òù Finite
  details: Bottomless feeds and auto-play keep users from leaving but lock them into an infinite loop of consumption. We can maximize the overall quality of time spent by bounding the experience and prioritizing meaningful and relevant content.
- title: ü§ù Inclusive
  details: Thinking inclusively is about considering diverse groups of people, how they will interact with your product, and their environments. It's a methodology that puts people's needs first and foremost to expand the reach of the product to the largest range of users possible.
- title: üôè Respectful
  details: Attention has become the scarce commodity of the digital age. As designers, we must consider how we deliver notifications to ensure we are respectful of their time, attention and overall digital well-being.
- title: ‚úã Thoughtful
  details: The presumption that reducing friction is virtuous onto itself is dangerous. We can embrace thoughtful friction to prevent harm and abuse, protect people's privacy and security, and steer them towards healthier digital habits.
- title: ‚úå Transparent
  details: Lack of transparency erodes trust in a product. We can prevent this erosion by demanding that the products we design are clear and honest about the data that‚Äôs being collected from users and why it‚Äôs being collected, how this data will be used, and avoiding dark patterns that exploit human psychological vulnerabilities.
